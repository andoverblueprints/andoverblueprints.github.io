                <p>In the fall of 2020, Andover Blueprints will compete in the virtual F1 in Schools North America
                    competition. Though the competition is virtual this season, the team is excited to compete, since
                    various logistical issues have impeded their ability to register for past years. The team has been
                    working hard on the car design, pit booth, portfolio presentations, and other aspects of the
                    competition, and plans to develop each component to its maximum potential this season.</p>

                <h2>Past</h2>
                <p>Andover Blueprints began their journey with Real World Design Challenge in 2016, winning first place
                    in Massachusetts. In 2017, they won the national title. Ever interested in trying new things, the
                    team sought out F1 in Schools. They advanced to nationals in 2018. Since 2018, the team has been
                    unable to attend F1 in Schools due to timing with required exams, as well as the novel Coronavirus
                    pandemic. However, years of hard work have kept the team sharp, and they are excited for the 2020
                    Nationals competition.</p>
